    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tensoba, or Tempura Soba is a Japanese dish of soba noodles and tempura.</p>
    <p>
        There are two varieties of tensoba. One is served with hot broth using dashi and soy sauce, and the other one is served with
        cooled soba and dipped in chilled/hot tsukejiru (lit. dipping sauce), usually strongly flavored. The dipping variety is also
         called 'Tenzaru-soba' or 'Ten-seiro,' depending on the soba shop or stand.

        <li>1 sweet potato, cut into 2cm thick slices</li>
        <li>1 aubergine, cut into 2cm thick slices</li>
        <li>1 courgette, cut into 2cm thick slices</li>
        <li>8 shitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 parsnip, peeled and cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 carrot, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch spring onions, chopped</li>
        <li>8 king prawns, peeled and de-veined</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>100ml sesame oil</li>
        <li>For the broth:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>800ml vegetable stock</li>
            <li>50ml soy sauce</li>
            <li>100ml mirin</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the tempura batter:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>300g self raising flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>200ml ice cold water</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the batter, pour the flour in a bowl. Mix the egg in a separate bowl and add the water.
             Slowly pour the water/egg mixture into the flour and lightly mix. The batter should still be slightly lumpy. Season.</li>
        <li>To make the broth, pour all the ingredients into a pan, season to taste and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes then drain and refresh in cold water.</li>
        <li>Pour the vegetable and sesame oil in a pan and heat up. Test the temperature by adding a small drop of tempura batter in the oil,
             if it rises to the surface then the oil is ready.</li>
        <li>Individually coat the vegetables in the batter and deep fry until crisp. Leave the prawns until last.</li>
        <li>To serve, place some soba in the bottom of a bowl, top with the tempura, pour the broth into the bowl and finally
             finish with some spring onions.</li>
    </ol>
