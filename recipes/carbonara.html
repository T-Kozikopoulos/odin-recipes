    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form,
         with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion chopped</li>
        <li>½ lb chopped guanciale</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons grated Pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>3 fresh egg yolks, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 large egg at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup of chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 6 quart sauce pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts of water and 1 tablespoons of salt.</li>
        <li>Place the oil in a skillet, over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent and before they get colored add the bacon.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta al dente, following the manufacturer recommendations. At the same time, let the onion and bacon cook until the fat melts;
             then simmer at a very low heat, until ready to use.</li>
        <li>In a large serving bowl beat the eggs 2 tablespoons of grated cheese, ½ of the parsley, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is cooked, drain the pasta and reserve a cup of the cooking liquid. Return spaghetti in the same pot and add the eggs and
             cheese mixture; the eggs will cook and get stuck to the hot pasta.</li>
        <li>Add the bacon and onion and quickly mix it well until pasta and sauce are combined. Add 2 additional tablespoons of grated cheese, and
             some of the reserved water, enough to moisten the pasta to a creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Divide the spaghetti in 4 dishes and sprinkle each dish with the remaining cheese, garnish with parsley and plenty of freshly ground
             black pepper.</li>
        <li>My niece Mrs. Marzia Fiorilla adds into the frying bacon and onion some blanched artichokes’ hearts for extra taste and color.</li>
        <li>P.S.: My aunt Francesca, who preferred the eggs well cooked, mixed the spaghetti and the egg sauce over a medium heat, for just a minute
             or until the eggs would start to coagulate. Then she would transfer the pasta in a large bowl and add the bacon, onions,
              cheese and some of the cooking liquid enough to moisten the pasta to a creamy consistency.</li>
    </ol>
