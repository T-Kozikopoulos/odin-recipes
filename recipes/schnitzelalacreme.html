    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe from an Australian Women's Weekly magazine dated April 14, 1971 that the MIL gave a copy to me as the family
         very much enjoyed when she made it. Well since making it I think my MIL did not measure her mushrooms so I have since changed to suit what I cooked as per recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds veal steaks (cut thin)</li>
        <li>2 ounces butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion chopped</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li> 2 ounces butter (extra)</li>
        <li> 10 ounces mushrooms (sliced)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brandy</li>
        <li>1 cup cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare steaks as for Wiener Schnitzel - pound out till thin and then crumb the steaks if you wish which is my preference.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and oil in a frying pan/skillet and add prepared steaks, cook quickly until golden brown on both sides, reduce heat,
             cook gently until tender, approximately 5 minutes, remove steaks and keep warm and drain the pan.</li>
        <li>Melt extra butter, add mushrooms, saut√© until tender, remove from heat, add flour, stir until smooth and cook,
             stirring constantly for 2 minutes and then add brandy, stir until mixture boils and thickens and then add cream,
              heat gently, do not boil, season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spoon mushrooms over steaks.</li>
    </ol>
